    <h2>Reading Excercises</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A Vector type</li>
            <p>Write a class Vec that represents a vector in two-dimensional space. It takes x and y parameters (numbers), which it should save to properties of the same name</p>
            <p>Give the Vec prototype two methods, plus and minus, that take another vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two 
                vectors’ (this and the parameter) x and y values.</p>
            <p>Add a getter property length to the prototype that computes the length of the vector—that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).</p>
            <pre>
                // Your code here.

                console.log(new Vec(1, 2).plus(new Vec(2, 3)));
                // → Vec{x: 3, y: 5}
                console.log(new Vec(1, 2).minus(new Vec(2, 3)));
                // → Vec{x: -1, y: -1}
                console.log(new Vec(3, 4).length);
                // → 5
                </pre>
        <li>Borrowing a method</li>
            <p>Earlier in the chapter I mentioned that an object’s hasOwnProperty can be used as a more robust alternative to the in operator when you want to 
                ignore the prototype’s properties. But what if your map needs to include the word "hasOwnProperty"? You won’t be able to call that method anymore 
                because the object’s own property hides the method value.</p>
            <p>Can you think of a way to call hasOwnProperty on an object that has its own property by that name?</p>
            <pre>let map = {one: true, two: true, hasOwnProperty: true};

                // Fix this call
                console.log(map.hasOwnProperty("one"));
                // → true
            </pre>
