            <h2>Reading Excercises (resolved in console)</h2>
            <h4>Loops Etc...</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Looping a triangle</li>
                    <p>Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:</p>
                    <p>#<br>##<br>###<br>####<br>#####<br>######<br>#######</p>
                <li>Fizz Buzz</li>
                    <p>Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with 
                        two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for 
                        numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.</p>
                    <p>When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that 
                    are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).</p>
                <li>Chessboard</li>
                    <p>Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. 
                        At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.</p>
                    <p>Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;# # # #<br># # # #<br>&nbsp;# # # #<br># # # #<br>&nbsp;# # # #<br># # # #<br>&nbsp;# # # #<br># # # #</p>
                    <p>When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that 
                        it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.</p>
            </ol>

            <h4>Functions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Minimum</li>
                    <p>The previous chapter introduced the standard function Math.min that returns its smallest argument. We can build 
                        something like that now. Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.</p>
                    <p>We will test the output of:</p>
                    <p>console.log(min(0,10));<p>
                    <p>console.log(min(0,-10));</p>
                <li>Recursion</li>
                    <p>We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to see 
                        whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Zero is even</li>
                        <li>One is odd</li>
                        <li>For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter 
                        (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.</p>
                    <p>Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?</p>
                <li>Bean Counting</li>
                    <p>You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string"[N]. The returned value will be a string 
                        containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position 0, which causes the last one to be 
                        found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.</p>
                    <p>Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B”
                         characters there are in the string.</p>
                    <p>Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the 
                        character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.</p>
                    <p>We will test the following in the console:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>console.log(countBs("BBC"));</li>
                        <li>console.log(countChar("kakkerlak", "k"))</li>
                    </ul>
            </ol>
