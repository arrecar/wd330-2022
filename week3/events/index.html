            <ol>
                <li>Balloon</li>
                    <p>Write a page that displays a balloon (using the balloon emoji, üéà). When you press the up arrow, it should inflate (grow) 10 percent, 
                        and when you press the down arrow, it should deflate (shrink) 10 percent.</p>
                    <p>You can control the size of text (emoji are text) by setting the font-size CSS property (style.fontSize) on its parent element. 
                        Remember to include a unit in the value‚Äîfor example, pixels (10px).</p>
                    <p>The key names of the arrow keys are "ArrowUp" and "ArrowDown". Make sure the keys change only the balloon, without scrolling the page.</p>
                    <p>When that works, add a feature where, if you blow up the balloon past a certain size, it explodes. In this case, exploding means that it is 
                        replaced with an üí• emoji, and the event handler is removed (so that you can‚Äôt inflate or deflate the explosion).</p>
                        <p id="balloon">üéà</p>
                <li>Mouse trail</li>
                    <p>In JavaScript‚Äôs early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages with lots of animated images, people came up with some truly 
                        inspiring ways to use the language.</p>
                    <p>One of these was the mouse trail‚Äîa series of elements that would follow the mouse pointer as you moved it across the page.</p>
                    <p>In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely positioned &ltdiv&gt elements with a fixed size and background color 
                        (refer to the code in the ‚ÄúMouse Clicks‚Äù section for an example). Create a bunch of such elements and, when the mouse moves, display them in 
                        the wake of the mouse pointer.</p>
                    <p>There are various possible approaches here. You can make your solution as simple or as complex as you want. A simple solution to start with is 
                        to keep a fixed number of trail elements and cycle through them, moving the next one to the mouse‚Äôs current position every time a "mousemove" 
                        event occurs.</p>
                <li>Tabs</li>
                    <p>Tabbed panels are widely used in user interfaces. They allow you to select an interface panel by choosing from a number of tabs ‚Äústicking out‚Äù 
                        above an element.</p>
                    <p>In this exercise you must implement a simple tabbed interface. Write a function, asTabs, that takes a DOM node and creates a tabbed interface 
                        showing the child elements of that node. It should insert a list of &ltbutton&gt elements at the top of the node, one for each child element, 
                            containing text retrieved from the data-tabname attribute of the child. All but one of the original children should be hidden (given a 
                            display style of none). The currently visible node can be selected by clicking the buttons.</p>
                    <p>When that works, extend it to style the button for the currently selected tab differently so that it is obvious which tab is selected.</p>
                    <tab-panel>
                        <div data-tabname="one">Tab one</div>
                        <div data-tabname="two">Tab two</div>
                        <div data-tabname="three">Tab three</div>
                      </tab-panel>
            </ol>
