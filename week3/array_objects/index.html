    <h1>Arrays and Objects</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>The Sum of a Range</li>
            <p>The introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way to compute the sum of a range of numbers:</p>
            <p>console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));</p>
            <p>Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from 
                start up to (and including) end.</p>
            <p>Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the example program 
                and see whether it does indeed return 55.</p>
            <p>As a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional third argument that indicates the “step” value used 
                when building the array. If no step is given, the elements go up by increments of one, corresponding to the old behavior. 
                The function call range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Make sure it also works with negative step values so that 
                range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].</p>
        <li>Reversin an Array</li>
            <p>Arrays have a reverse method that changes the array by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, 
                write two functions, reverseArray and reverseArrayInPlace. The first, reverseArray, takes an array as argument and produces 
                a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The second, reverseArrayInPlace, does what the reverse method does: 
                it modifies the array given as argument by reversing its elements. Neither may use the standard reverse method.</p>
            <p>Thinking back to the notes about side effects and pure functions in the previous chapter, which variant do you expect to be useful 
                in more situations? Which one runs faster?</p>
        <li>A list</li>
            <p>Objects, as generic blobs of values, can be used to build all sorts of data structures. A common data structure is the list 
                (not to be confused with array). A list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the second, 
                the second to the third, and so on.</p>
            <p>A nice thing about lists is that they can share parts of their structure. For example, if I create two new values {value: 0, rest: list} 
                and {value: -1, rest: list} (with list referring to the binding defined earlier), they are both independent lists, but they share the 
                structure that makes up their last three elements. The original list is also still a valid three-element list.</p>
            <p>Write a function arrayToList that builds up a list structure like the one shown when given [1, 2, 3] as argument. Also write a 
                listToArray function that produces an array from a list. Then add a helper function prepend, which takes an element and a list 
                and creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns 
                the element at the given position in the list (with zero referring to the first element) or undefined when there is no such element.</p>
        <li>Deep Comparison</li>
            <p>The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes you’d prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.</p>
            <p>Write a function deepEqual that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or are objects with the same 
                properties, where the values of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual.</p>
            <p>To find out whether values should be compared directly (use the === operator for that) or have their properties compared, 
                you can use the typeof operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a deep comparison. But you have to 
                take one silly exception into account: because of a historical accident, typeof null also produces "object".</p>
            <p>The Object.keys function will be useful when you need to go over the properties of objects to compare them.</p>
