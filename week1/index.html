            <h1>Week1</h1>
            <h3>Notes from video</h3>
            <h5>Mobile first design</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Design on the smallest and least powerful device to focus on core functionalities and main content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We now need to design for several type of devices of screen sizes and resolution(desktop, mobile, tablet, etc)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whatever you do, do mobile first
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Mobile inputs or forms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Make it simple so people can use it easily</li>
                <li>Problem with forms is the amount of information requested from the user</li>
                <li>Labels and inputs will make the form compacted or full. You can ditch the labels and just have the inputs display a placeholder</li>
            </ul>
